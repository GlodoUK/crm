# CRM related addons for Odoo

This project aims to deal with any generalised modules related to CRM for Odoo.

## Support and Contributing

Whilst the code is open source we have typically built these modules for ourselves, or for customers. As such all support outside of our customer base is limited/at our discretion.

We are happy to accept contributions.

All modules in this repo are released for use "AS IS" without any warranties of any kind, including, but not limited to their installation, use, or performance.
